## Problem
Communication for Effective Debt Recovery
In the world of debt recovery, communication is everything ‚Äî yet current methods often fall short depending on the client type and situation.

Emails are the preferred mode of communication for corporate clients due to their formality and ease of documentation. However, they often lack urgency and are easily ignored or left unread.

Phone calls add a personal touch and are harder to ignore, making them ideal for follow-ups. Still, many clients avoid answering if they suspect it's related to collections.

Physical visits typically result in stronger repayment commitments and even on-the-spot payments, but they require significant time, cost, and planning. They are also not scalable or practical for clients in remote locations.

## Solution
Project Idea: ‚ÄúDebtPulse‚Äù ‚Äì A Smart Communication & Risk Tracker for Debt Recovery Teams
